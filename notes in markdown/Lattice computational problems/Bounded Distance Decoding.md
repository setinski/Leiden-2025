>The Boundary Distance Decoding Problem with approximation factor $\alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$, denoted ==$\alpha$-BDD==, is defined as follows:
>- Given as input the [[Basis of a lattice|basis]] $\mathbf{B}$ of a [[Lattice]] $\mathcal{L} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and a target $\mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $d(\mathbf{t},\mathcal{L}) < \alpha \lambda_{1}(\mathcal{L})$
>- Output the unique $\mathbf{v} \in \mathcal{L}$ such that $\| \mathbf{v} -\mathbf{t} \| < \alpha \lambda_{1}(\mathcal{L})$.
>
>The problem is denoted as ==AbsBDD== if $\alpha \lambda_{1}(\mathcal{L})$ is replaced by an absolute quantity that does nontheless guarantee uniqueness (i.e. is less than $\frac{1}{2} \lambda_{1}(\mathcal{L})$).
